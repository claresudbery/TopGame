Golden Masters:
	001: Only 52 sets of data (one for each possible number of cards in the loop) - didn't take account of different numbers of players.
	001-new-props: Same as 001, but with NumTotalSegments renamed to NumCardsInLoop, and with new NumPlayersInGame added - so that it can be compared with newer versions.
	002: (52 x 11) sets of data - for each possible number of cards, also had between 2 and 12 players.
	003: c3bccdf17481809679462db7fd60915d30011a02: Lost track of what I was doing. Regenerated the file to make sure I hadn't changed anythign and forgotten.
	004: c926496202b08255406564e0ef3ab5d413e4795e: Checked out previous version of code to see what golden master was generated.
	005: f6c721b4b7aad6a9d86388c733761992643671e7: Bug fixed - GetMaxCentralAngle is now using the correct number of hands in its if statement, rather than always using 3.

To do:
	Get doubles rounded to 6 dec places
	See whether the data is the same if you just copy list of regions directly
	Add in list of colours
	Find out whether subregions can be recreated using everything in VitalStatistics. If not, add in subregions to golden master.
