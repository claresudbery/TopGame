The number of possible games is 52!/(36!x(4!^4)) = (52x51x...38x37)/(4!^4) = (2.168269411362289 x 10^26) / 331776
= 6.535341348868782 x 10^20 = 653,534,134,886,878,200,000

6.535341348868782 x 10^20 seconds = 1.0892236e+19 minutes
1.0892236e+19 minutes = 1.8153726e+17 hours
1.8153726e+17 hours = 7.5640525e+15 days
7.5640525e+15 days = 1.0805789e+15 weeks
1.0805789e+15 weeks = 2.0780364e+13 years

= 20,780,364,000,000 years = 20 thousand billion years

In milliseconds, it's 20,780,364,000 years = 20 billion years
The universe is (apparently) 4.5 billion years old!

The number of possible card pack combinations is 52!, which is really big: 21 digits I think.

Changing the cursor during drag-n-drop:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6175408/is-it-possible-to-change-mouse-cursor-when-handling-drag-from-dragover-event

bugs:
when the moving line crosses a border, the chunks briefly change size.
After the moving line enters the player's hand, the num of aces (in a clean game) has changed?
The list of colours is not updating correctly.
If you click Player Wins when no cards have been played, there is a delay and then a change in the relevant player's pack.
1. After a win, the 'cards in play' card list doesn't update until the next card is played.
2. The card images don't refresh instantly, so you quite often see the previous card played by that player (or no card at all), instead of the current card.
3. When you click the Undo button, the coloured graphic isn't changed accordingly.

Fixing the drag-drop problem:
1. Fiddle about with the struct in the Tag, to make sure that data really is reset.
2. Don't reset the image until you are in the Paint handler, at which point just check a global flag which stores the emptied picture box name.
3. Get the graphics object from the sender and use that
4. Check for other drag events, eg drag leave.
